// 1. Your predicted output I predict this will be a count down from 5 then ending with the word blastoff



public class P8_Launch {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("T-minus ");
        for( int i = 5; i >= 1; i-- ) {
            System.out.print( i + ", " );
        }
        System.out.println("Blastoff!");

	}

}



// 3. Were you correct? Explain any differences and what you learned yes. T-minus being the title then counting down from five ending from blastoff.
